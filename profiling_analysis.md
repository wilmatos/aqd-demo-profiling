```

Key observations:
1. **Gaussian Blur Operation**: The most time-consuming operation (0.268 seconds total)
   - This is in `apply_blur` method using `ImageFilter.GaussianBlur`

2. **Image Blending**: Takes 0.138 seconds total
   - Used in the enhancement operations (contrast, brightness, sharpness)

3. **Image Filtering**: Takes 0.117 seconds total
   - Used in various filter operations

4. **Image Decoding**: Takes 0.109 seconds
   - Part of the image loading process

5. **Image Copying**: 25 calls to `Image.copy()` taking 0.134 seconds total
   - Each transformation method creates a new copy unnecessarily

### Memory Profiling

    47                                             """Run the image processor with memory profiling."""
    48     35.0 MiB      0.0 MiB           1       processor = ImageProcessor(input_dir, output_dir)
    49     35.0 MiB     -0.0 MiB           1       processor.process_all_images()
```

The memory profile doesn't show significant memory issues with the small test set. The application uses about 35 MiB of memory.

### Time Profiling
Total execution time was 0.71 seconds for processing 5 images, with an average of 0.14 seconds per image.

## Performance Bottlenecks Identified

1. **Inefficient File Listing**: 
   - The `get_image_files()` method walks through all files multiple times, once for each extension.
   - This becomes increasingly inefficient as the number of files or supported extensions grows.

2. **Unnecessary Image Copies**: 
   - Each transformation method creates a new copy of the image with `image.copy()`.
   - There are 25 calls to the copy method, consuming significant time.

3. **Sequential Processing**: 
   - Images are processed one at a time with no parallelism.
   - This doesn't utilize modern multi-core processors effectively.

4. **Inefficient Image Operations**:
   - Using `Image.NEAREST` for resizing (lower quality and not much faster)
   - High quality setting (95) when saving images
   - Gaussian blur is the most expensive operation (0.268s)

5. **Redundant Conversions**: 
   - Converting to RGB mode even when not needed.

## Optimization Opportunities

Based on the profiling results, here are the key areas for optimization:

1. **Implement Parallel Processing**: 
   - Use `concurrent.futures` or `multiprocessing` to process images in parallel.
   - This could significantly improve throughput on multi-core systems.

2. **Reduce Unnecessary Copies**: 
   - Modify the transformation methods to avoid creating copies when not needed.
   - Chain operations where possible to reduce intermediate copies.

3. **Optimize File Listing**: 
   - Use a more efficient approach to find image files (e.g., using `glob` or a single directory scan).
   - Filter by extension in a single pass rather than multiple passes.

4. **Optimize Image Operations**:
   - Use more efficient resize methods like `Image.LANCZOS` for better quality/speed balance.
   - Adjust quality settings when saving images based on requirements.
   - Consider if all transformations are necessary for every image.
   - Evaluate if the blur radius can be reduced without affecting quality.

5. **Add Error Handling**: 
   - Implement proper error handling for file operations.
   - Add graceful failure for corrupted images.

6. **Implement Caching**:
   - For repeated operations on the same images, consider caching results.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the optimizations in order of potential impact:
   - Parallel processing
   - Reduce unnecessary copies
   - Optimize file listing
   - Optimize image operations

2. Re-run profiling after each major optimization to measure improvement.

3. Consider additional optimizations based on updated profiling results.
