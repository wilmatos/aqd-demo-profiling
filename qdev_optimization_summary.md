# Development Optimization Log

## Initial Analysis

I'll share updates here as I work on this.

### Summary of changes

1. Initial Review
   - First examined key files to understand code structure
   - Identified potential bottlenecks
   - Understood profiling tools setup

2. Profiling Analysis
   - Examined profiling analysis report
   - Reviewed image processor implementation
   - Identified performance issues in image processing functions

3. Optimization Opportunities
   Identified main bottlenecks:
   - Unnecessary image copies in transformations
   - Sequential vs parallel processing issues
   - Inefficient file listing
   - Suboptimal image operations

4. Implementation Phase
   Focused on implementing:
   - Elimination of unnecessary image copies
   - Optimization of file listing process
   - Implementation of parallel processing
   - Improvement of image operations efficiency
   - Optimization of conversion logic

## Progress Updates

### Testing and Validation
- Created optimized version of image processor
- Developed test scripts for comparison
- Updated optimization summary with performance measurements

### Implementation Progress
- Installed dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
